# Workout Tracker
Workout tracker is a desktop application developed in Java and JavaFX. The goal of this tracker was to allow for workouts to be entered on the Workout screen and then update the relevant information on the Big 3 and Personal Best. The Big 3 screen graphs the progress of the flat bench, squats, and deadlift exercises. Finally, the Personal Best screen logs all the personal bests weights for both the "Strength" and "Reps" workout types.

I define the "Strength" workout type as any exercise perfomed in the rep range of 3-5, while "Reps" are in the rep range of 8-12/to failure.
